# Coding-Examples
Hi!

My name is Carlos Revilla, I am in my final year at the University of Virginia completing my bachelors of Arts in Computer Science and my Data Science Minor in the new School of Data Science!

I wanted to provide an easy way for potential employers and also colleagues to check out some of my coding examples - so I made this repo with some examples from CS courses at the university of Virginia to Personal Projects. Please feel free to reach out to me if there is anything that would like more information on or if you just want to have a chat :D
