Steps for Data Cleaning:
- Read the CSV file
- Extracted all the data for 2018, 2021, and 2022 (no data for 2019, 2020)
- Chose 3 subject variables (age, sex, and marital) and 1 target variable (fluvax)
- We dropped the N/A columns for fluvax and age (as we could not perform analysis without these columns)
- Plotted a histogram for fluvax vs age
- Created a count plot for fluvax vs sex
- Created a count plot for fluvax vs marital
- Attempted to perform in-depth analysis for each filtered year (the last 3 years - 2018, 2021, 2022) but realized
    that after dropping the invalid data entries, the only remaining data was from the year 2022 (with respect to
    the last 3 recent years).
- The project started out with the intent of analyzing the relationship between flu vaccines and age, sex, and
    marital for the 3 recent years; however, through the data wrangling/visualization process, the scope of the
    project changed to just the recent year (2022) due to the data missing from 2018 and 2021.
- Added a chi-squared test for independence to check if the results for gender vs fluvax and marital status vs fluvax were         statistically significant
