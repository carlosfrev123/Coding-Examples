Abstract
This code examines the relationship between the uptake of the flu vaccine and various demographic factors, including age, sex, and marital status, by analyzing a dataset from the General Social Survey (GSS). Initially, data from the years 2018, 2021, and 2022 are filtered out of the larger dataset, which includes various variables from different years. The primary focus is on the 'age', 'sex', 'marital', and 'fluvax' columns, which indicate a person's age, gender, marital status, and whether they received the flu vaccine, respectively. After cleaning the dataset of missing values, histograms and count plots are generated to visually assess the relationship between vaccine uptake and age. Moreover, count plots are also created to depict the relationship of vaccine uptake with gender and marital status. The same visualizations are repeated for the year 2022 alone, allowing for a more specific temporal insight. 

Through the visualizations, one can discern patterns or trends related to the demographics of individuals who have been vaccinated against the flu versus those who have not.
