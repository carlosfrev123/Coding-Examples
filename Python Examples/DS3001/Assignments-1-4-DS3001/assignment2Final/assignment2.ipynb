        "    \n",
        "    -> The tidy data standard is intended to provide a univeral standard for data tidying to have consistency amongst anyone who wishes to understand the data of a data table that uses that standard. As long as there is consistency within the standard one is able to traverse any data set that uses the tidy data standard. Kind of like if you are able to learn the alphabet you should be able to learn and eventually understand every word that uses that alphabet.\n",

What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, itâ€™s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",

        "    ->\"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" Each tidy data set follows the same standard just like a \"tidy\" family or healthy family follows a similarity. To clarify if we take the nuclear family as the standard for \"healthy\" then all nuclear families are alike. Howver all non nuclear families are very different in the same way any messy dataset will follow its own standard so it will be different to every other messy dataset on top of being different to the tidy datasets.\n",

        "    -> tidy data is defined as a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. In tidy data 3 rules are defined.\n",

        "    -> 5 most common problems with messy datasets are: \n",
        "    Column headers are values, not variable names.\n",
        "    Multiple variables are stored in one column.\n",

        "    A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.\n",
        "    -> in table 4 Column headers are values, multiple variables are stored in both rows and columns: the column headers are ranges which are variables and the row headers are variables. \n",
        "    -> melting in a dataset is the process of turning columns into rows\n",
        "\n",
        "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -> table 11 stores date in separate columns. Table 11 leaves multiple columns blank.\n",
        "    -> table 12 stores values into separate tables molten and tidy as to separate overlapping values taken from table 11.\n",
