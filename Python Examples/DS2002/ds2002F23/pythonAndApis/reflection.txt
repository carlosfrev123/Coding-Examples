a. Security Mechanisms:
The API utilizes token-based authentication to ensure only authorized users can access the data. 
Every API call is accompanied by an Authorization header bearing a token. 
Without this token, or with an invalid or expired token, the request would be denied.

b. Errors Encountered:
While testing the code, a few potential errors were identified:

The stock ticker entered by the user might not exist.
The API might not respond or return an error due to various reasons (rate limits, server errors, etc.).
The program explicitly checks for HTTP errors and informs the user if there's an issue fetching the data.

c. Resources Used:
Mainly, the documentation at financeapi.net was referred to. 
This documentation provided the necessary endpoints, parameters, 
and sample responses required to design the program. 
For Python-specific syntax and library methods, the Python official documentation and some community forums like StackOverflow were referred to.
